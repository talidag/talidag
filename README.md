Hello!

I'm **Talida Ganciu**, a self-taught frontend developer and designer with a passion for creating accessible digital experiences. Formerly a call center agent, I've transitioned into coding to make technology more user-friendly, especially for those facing challenges.

My journey started with VBA programming but shifted to frontend development due to my love for visual design. 

Outside of coding, I wear many hats - I'm a proud mom, devoted wife, avid football fan, and pescatarian. I find joy in stand-up comedy, maintain my sanity with pilates, and enjoy cuddle sessions with my Saint Bernard and my cat.

Let's connect and collaborate on making the web a better place for everyone! ‚≠ê
