## Welcome to my Github profile! 

I'm a **`Frontend Developer`** with a passion for **`UI/UX Design`** and a love for turning ideas into stunning, user-friendly websites. <br/>
My coding journey began with learning Python, but it didn't take long for me to discover my true love for frontend development.

Outside of coding, I wear many hats - I'm a proud mom, devoted wife, avid football fan, and pescatarian. I find joy in stand-up comedy, maintain my sanity with pilates, and enjoy cuddle sessions with my Saint Bernard and my cat.

Let's connect and collaborate on making the web a better place for everyone! ⭐
